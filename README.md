sens_smr: this is used to estimate the causal sensitivity analyses for the standardized mortality rate outcome in R
sens_life: this is used to estimate the causal sensitivty analyses for the life expectancy outcome in R
sens_inf: this is used to estimate the causal sensitivty analyses for the infant mortality rate outcome in R
wageR2: this is used to estimate the mediation analysis in R

All but the first data file is directly derived from the code below.
